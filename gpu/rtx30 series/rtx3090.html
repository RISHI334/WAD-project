        <p>The RTX 3090 is a high-end graphics card manufactured by Nvidia. It was released in September 2020 as part of the RTX 30 series of graphics cards and is based on Nvidia's Ampere architecture.The RTX 3090 features 10,496 CUDA cores, 328 Tensor cores, and 82 Ray Tracing cores.<br><br>It has a base clock speed of 1.4 GHz and a boost clock speed of 1.7 GHz. It also has 24 GB of GDDR6X memory, which provides a memory bandwidth of 936 GB/s.<br><br>

            One of the key features of the RTX 3090 is its support for real-time ray tracing, a technology that allows for realistic lighting and reflections in games and other applications. The RTX 3090 also supports Nvidia's DLSS technology, which uses AI to improve image quality and performance.<br><br>
        
            In terms of performance, the RTX 3090 is one of the most powerful consumer graphics cards on the market, capable of delivering high frame rates at 4K resolution and even higher frame rates at lower resolutions. It is designed for use in high-end gaming PCs, as well as for tasks such as 3D rendering, video editing, and machine learning.</p>

                    <div id="rtx" class="collapse">Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics to generate realistic images of 3D scenes. It works by simulating the behavior of light in a virtual environment, tracing the path of light rays as they bounce off objects and interact with the camera and other elements in the scene.In a ray tracing algorithm, a virtual camera is placed in the scene and a ray is cast from the camera through each pixel of the image. This ray is then traced as it bounces off objects in the scene, with the color and intensity of the ray's interaction with each object calculated based on the properties of the object's material and the direction and intensity of the light source(s) in the scene. These calculations are repeated for each ray, with the final image being generated by combining the color and intensity of each ray that intersects the camera's view frustum.</div>

                <div  id="dlss" class="collapse">DLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling, which is a proprietary technology developed by NVIDIA. DLSS uses deep learning algorithms and neural networks to improve the performance of real-time rendering and reduce the computational requirements of high-resolution rendering.The basic principle of DLSS is to use a lower-resolution image as input to the neural network, which then generates a higher-resolution image that is visually similar to the original. This process can be repeated multiple times to achieve even higher resolutions. By using a lower-resolution input, the computational requirements are significantly reduced, allowing for higher performance and faster frame rates.</div>

It provides developers with access to the hardware resources of the system, allowing for more efficient and effective use of the graphics processing unit (GPU).DirectX 12 offers a number of benefits over previous versions of DirectX, including improved performance, reduced CPU overhead, and support for new hardware features such as asynchronous compute and multi-GPU rendering. It also allows for more fine-grained control over the graphics pipeline, enabling developers to optimize their code for specific hardware configurations and achieve greater visual fidelity in their games and applications.</div>
