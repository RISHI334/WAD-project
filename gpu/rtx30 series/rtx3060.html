                    <div id="rtx" class="collapse">Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics to generate realistic images of 3D scenes. It works by simulating the behavior of light in a virtual environment, tracing the path of light rays as they bounce off objects and interact with the camera and other elements in the scene.In a ray tracing algorithm, a virtual camera is placed in the scene and a ray is cast from the camera through each pixel of the image. This ray is then traced as it bounces off objects in the scene, with the color and intensity of the ray's interaction with each object calculated based on the properties of the object's material and the direction and intensity of the light source(s) in the scene. These calculations are repeated for each ray, with the final image being generated by combining the color and intensity of each ray that intersects the camera's view frustum.</div>

                <div  id="dlss" class="collapse">DLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling, which is a proprietary technology developed by NVIDIA. DLSS uses deep learning algorithms and neural networks to improve the performance of real-time rendering and reduce the computational requirements of high-resolution rendering.The basic principle of DLSS is to use a lower-resolution image as input to the neural network, which then generates a higher-resolution image that is visually similar to the original. This process can be repeated multiple times to achieve even higher resolutions. By using a lower-resolution input, the computational requirements are significantly reduced, allowing for higher performance and faster frame rates.</div>

                    <div id="dx12" class="collapse">DirectX 12 is a low-level graphics API (application programming interface) developed by Microsoft for Windows-based computers and game consoles. It provides developers with access to the hardware resources of the system, allowing for more efficient and effective use of the graphics processing unit (GPU).DirectX 12 offers a number of benefits over previous versions of DirectX, including improved performance, reduced CPU overhead, and support for new hardware features such as asynchronous compute and multi-GPU rendering. It also allows for more fine-grained control over the graphics pipeline, enabling developers to optimize their code for specific hardware configurations and achieve greater visual fidelity in their games and applications.</div>
