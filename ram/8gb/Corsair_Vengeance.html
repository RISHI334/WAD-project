            <td colspan="2"><p class="abt">The Corsair Vengeance 8GB RAM is a computer memory module designed for use in desktop computers. Here are some of its key features:<br><br></p>
                <ol class="abt">

                <li> The Vengeance RAM module has a capacity of 8GB, which means it can store and access up to 8 gigabytes of data at once.</li>
                
                <li>Speed: The Vengeance RAM has a clock speed of 1600MHz, which means it can transfer data at a rate of 1600 million cycles per second.</li>
                
                <li >technology: The Vengeance RAM uses DDR3 (Double Data Rate 3) technology, which allows it to transfer data twice per clock cycle, effectively doubling its transfer rate.</li>
                
                <li>Heat spreader: The Vengeance RAM module comes with a built-in heat spreader that helps dissipate heat, which can be especially important in high-performance systems where heat buildup can lead to stability issues.</li>
                
               <li>Low latency: The Vengeance RAM module has a CAS latency of 9, which means it has a relatively low latency for DDR3 RAM. This can improve overall system performance by reducing the amount of time it takes for the RAM to respond to data requests.</li> 
           </ol>
           <p class="abt">
               Overall, the Corsair Vengeance 8GB RAM is a high-quality memory module that can improve the performance of your desktop computer, particularly in applications that require a lot of memory or data transfer speed.</p></td>
